=========== Building ==============


	-= Prequisites =-

xlslib: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xlslib/
libcsv: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libcsv/
Compiler: C++17 compiler (gcc 7, clang 5)
cmake

If you have an older compiler, you will be able to compile tag 0.3.5.

        -= Compile =-

cmake .
make
        -= Install =-

If 'PREFIX' is not set by configure parameter, the binary will get installed in
/usr/local/bin.

make install

or to install a stripped (w/o debugging symbols -> smaller) binary do

make install-strip

	-= Windows (MinGW) =-

You need MinGW installed. Make sure you enable 'C++' and 'MSYS' during
installation process.
Not to forget: You will need to compile and install libcsv and xlslib
before compiling csv2xls.

Then follow this example by changing the paths to your needs:


We assume this folder is unzipped and its path is 'C:\csv2xls-0.0.0'.
Open MSYS console and type

  cd  /C/csv2xls-0.0.0
  cmake .
  make
  make install-strip

The 'csv2xls.exe' will be installed in 'C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\local\bin'.
It will be a static compiled binary which you can copy/move into
a path of your choice.
