But maybe for some people it is not possible or acceptable to install perl or phyton just for this small program.\r\nOn Linux phython and/or perl is often installed already. But on windows not.\r\nThis csv2xls can be cross compiled for windows on Linux with mingw.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* split output in several files, if max line limit exceeded\r\n* set work sheet name of xls output file\r\n* noninteractive -> useful for automated tasks\r\n* builds on Linux and Windows (mingw)\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n* produces only Excel(TM) 97/2000/XP/2003\r\n* no cell formatting, just plain text\r\n "}
