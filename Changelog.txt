    * issue #5: empty xls file
                Don't write a worksheet to a file, if it is empty or with just a head line.
    * issue #4: Failed to open file csv2xls (on Mac OSX)
                parcecmd.cpp: Don't initialize optind=0
                The system does that, but with value '1'. (see: man 3 getopt)
                So value '0' was wrong.
                Since we don't parse argv twice or more, there is no reason, to touch it.
    * fix:      memory leaks
    * build:    make use of config.h

Version: 0.2
    * removed boost as dependency
    * Don't allow less than 2 lines in xls file
      - If parameter '-H' is set and -l1 and csv input file has at least 2 lines,
        we end up in endless numbers of xls files with just the head line.
