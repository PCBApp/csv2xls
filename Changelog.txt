Version: 0.3.4
    * issue #8: crash on missing input file
                It was not enough to check on minimum one command line parameter.
                Given any valid option it passes this check, and tries to access a
                nonexisting argument.
    * issue #9: crash if inputfile name length is less than 4 chars
    * fix:      If option -H is not set, allow option -l1

Version: 0.3.3
    * issue #5: empty xls file
                Don't write a worksheet to a file, if it is empty or with just a head line.
    * issue #4: Failed to open file csv2xls (on Mac OSX)
                parcecmd.cpp: Don't initialize optind=0
                The system does that, but with value '1'. (see: man 3 getopt)
                So value '0' was wrong.
                Since we don't parse argv twice or more, there is no reason, to touch it.
    * fix:      memory leaks
    * build:    make use of config.h

Date:    Do 27. Dez 00:57:36 CET 2012

Date:    Sa 10. Nov 19:08:15 CET 2012
Version: 0.2
    * removed boost as dependency
    * Don't allow less than 2 lines in xls file
      - If parameter '-H' is set and -l1 and csv input file has at least 2 lines,
        we end up in endless numbers of xls files with just the head line.

Date:    Sun  4. Nov 05:25:11 CET 2012
